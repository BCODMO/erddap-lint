# erddap-lint
A lint tool for Erddap data server configurations.

This project contains rules and a simple static web application for running some verification tests against your ERDDAP server. All the tests are run in the web browser.

This is a new project; you're welcome to follow along but things may change suddenly and quickly. (We'll remove this statement when things become more stable!)

# The Rules
To add your own rules, see [How To Write Rules](WritingRules.md), then add your rules into the rules folder.
